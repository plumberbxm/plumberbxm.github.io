The pro will next check your water heater. With your water heater, he or she is looking at water temperature, pressure relief valves and pipes, and any rust in the tank (unless it's a tankless water heater ). Some will also flush your water heater at this time, which is an annual maintenance task that avoids difficult water and sediment accumulation. To do this, the plumber will drain the water out of the tank with a hose and run clean water through the tank to wash out any accumulation.</p>

If you have an older home, there's a good chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they start to wear away. This corrosion can lead to a buildup of lead, which can have lots of unfavorable impacts on your health. Corroded pipes likewise cause bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
