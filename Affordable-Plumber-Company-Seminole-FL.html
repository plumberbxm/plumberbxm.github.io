<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers Seminole FL</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was really touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Unfortunately, any home that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. Sometimes a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and muttering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential permits released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be evaluated annually. Likewise allows issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems require an annually test. It is required that this assembly is tested in the spring before running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers should be evaluated annually to guarantee the safety of the potable drinking water in your home.
