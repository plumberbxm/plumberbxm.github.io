<p>Trees and shrubs are a common reason for sewer obstructions to the home. Roots can turn into the tiniest fracture or space in your home's drain pipe, where they grow in the nutrient abundant environment offered by the sewer. Flat roofs normally have actually drains spaced out around their boundary.

<p>During the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this salt water passes through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are as a result sent to drain. This procedure continues until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll observe small amounts of salt going to drain together with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered totally regenerated.</p>
