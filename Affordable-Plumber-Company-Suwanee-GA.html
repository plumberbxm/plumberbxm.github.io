<p>In a watering system, backflow has two causes: back siphonage or back pressure. Nearly all parts on a hot water heater can be fixed or replaced except for the tank itself. As soon as the tank rusts through, there is no chance to repair it; replacement is the only service. Turn the garbage disposal over and remove electrical cover plate. Pull out wires.

The pipes can end up being brittle, over time, and might need replacement sooner than hoped.
