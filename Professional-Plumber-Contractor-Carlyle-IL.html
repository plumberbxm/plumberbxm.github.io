<p>Pretty little flappers might get all the glory in the toilet world, but the journey lever is the bridge between guy and machine.

And who wants to do all that work???

When connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher adapter is attached. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, taking care to link wires accurately, and the base covered to protect the circuitry from any water getting in.</p>

<p>When a water supply is being de-pressurized for a repair, it is important to make certain a backflow condition is not developed. The repair technician need to take care to not develop a backsiphonage condition by draining pipes the water from a higher elevations to lower elevation.

<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason we will suggest a complete repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>
