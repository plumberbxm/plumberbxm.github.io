<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common kind of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. When you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario could take place. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility considers high risk" facilities.</p>
<p>Backpressure might take place when the potable supply piping is linked to a system or component which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping.

Backflow Preventer meaning: A device that permits water to go through it in one direction, but avoids it from going backwards in the opposite instructions.</p>
