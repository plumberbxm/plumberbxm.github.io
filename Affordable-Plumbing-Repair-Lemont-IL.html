We offer a variety of InSinkErator ® waste disposal unit to fulfill your individual needs, or we can install whatever garbage disposal you provide us.</p>
<p>Water softening is the elimination of calcium, magnesium, and specific other metal cations in tough water. The resulting soft water is more compatible with soap and extends the lifetime of some home appliances. Water softening is typically achieved using ion-exchange resins.
