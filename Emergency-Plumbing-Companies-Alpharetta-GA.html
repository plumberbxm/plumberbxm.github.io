<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. When you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense fails (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow situation might take place. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company thinks about high danger" facilities.</p>
