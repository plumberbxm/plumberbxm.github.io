Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a quote. They right away cleared the preliminary obstruction, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
