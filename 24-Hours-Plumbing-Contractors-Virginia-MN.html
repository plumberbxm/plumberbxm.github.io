<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential authorizations provided after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was attached. By code this backflow assembly must be checked annually. Likewise permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems need an annually test. It is required that this assembly is evaluated in the spring prior to running the watering system.
