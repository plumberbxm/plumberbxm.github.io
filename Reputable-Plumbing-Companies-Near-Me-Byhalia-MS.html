These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Because water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately constant, usage never precisely matches supply.
