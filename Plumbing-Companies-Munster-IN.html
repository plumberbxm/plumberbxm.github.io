This really depends upon what condition the rest of the pipes are in, and how tough the old system is to remove.

<p>Hard water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it includes. When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water goes through to your home. When the resin bed fills up with firmness ions, it needs to be restored (cleaned up). Salt is typically used in the regeneration process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start once again.</p>
<p>Sluggish drains. A sluggish drain can be a common plumbing issue, and many clogs can be solved with a basic fix such as a plunger or drain cleaning. If the simple unclogging approaches do not work to fix the slow drain, the concern can be a deeper obstruction someplace in the main sewer line. Unfortunately, mainline clogs are normally much larger clogs than need more than simple unclogging methods, but digging into the line itself to access the source of the problem.</p>

<p>During the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water developed in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this salt water passes through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are subsequently sent to drain. This procedure continues till all the solidity ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll see small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the firmness ions) and the bed is considered completely regrowed.</p>
