Even if the system is off, the blades are sharp and unsafe. Ensure the system is off, you can even switch off the breaker to ensure it can't be turned on by mishap. Your waste disposal unit includes a. hex wrench that can be used to insert into the opening located at the bottom of the system. If you can't find this wrench, then try to insert a broom handle or plunger into the sink drain opening and try to rotate the jammed flywheel.
