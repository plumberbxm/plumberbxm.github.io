<p>Leakages are sly. While the time required will vary based upon your home size and the number of discovered breakdowns, it's best to set aside approximately 2 hours when you arrange an inspection. There's always the possibility that your plumber's previous job will run long and delay the starting time. If the plumber surfaces in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next visit, they likely rushed the task (unless you have a really little plumbing system). Ask how long the inspection generally takes when you call to schedule your visit.</p>
<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will collect in various parts of the plumbing system, many typically in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can cause low circulation issues and even stop a fixture from streaming altogether.
