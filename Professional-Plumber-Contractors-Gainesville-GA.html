These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to degrade in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working requirements. This means the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>

It includes an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard operational usage, water pressure pushes the seat up and blocks the air inlet.
