<p>The law also needs annual testing and inspection by a certified tester, and a report submitted to the DEP. Failure to comply can lead to charges and termination of water service. Because backflow preventer gadgets are comprised of moving springs, parts, and seals and are subject to corrosive substances, wear, and fatigue, it's important to correctly maintain them to guarantee they correctly run and play their part in keeping our city's drinking water safe.</p>
<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Check for leaks under the sink to validate that your plumber's putty is making a good seal. Eliminate the drain stopper, and allow the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Look for leaks and tighten up as necessary. Plug system into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and organize cords as wanted.

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to offer soft drinks drinks. Many, if not most, water pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate solution (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a threat to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping consisting of copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
