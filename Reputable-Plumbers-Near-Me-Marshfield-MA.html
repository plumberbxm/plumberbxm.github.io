<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential permits issued after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was attached. By code this backflow assembly must be evaluated annually. Likewise permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems require an every year test. It is needed that this assembly is tested in the spring prior to running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers need to be evaluated each year to insure the safety of the drinkable drinking water in your house.
