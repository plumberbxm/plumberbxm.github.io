<p>Gas and gas that comes out of the ground is totally odorless. The egg odor connected with gas is a chemical blended into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are safety precautions you need to take to protect yourself, your family and your house. Some jurisdictions also allow alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, since whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
