<p>Sometimes a clog can be caused due to accumulation and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain will not fix the problem. You may have to look into using a high pressure water system to remove the clog. This process is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the seriousness of the clog. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the whole system.</p>
