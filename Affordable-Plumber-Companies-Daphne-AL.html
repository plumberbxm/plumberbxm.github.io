<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of thousands of tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads end up being full of sodium ions from the water softener salt when newly regenerated. As tough water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your usage. When water is heated up, difficult water triggers white or gray deposits. Water softening can be used to reduce these symptoms.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you need to always run cold water while the waste disposal unit is on to ensure that food bits are fully pressed through. Hot water can trigger things like grease, oil, and starches to melt and pass through the disposal, but they will only strengthen further on down the drain, possibly resulting in a clog.

<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water created in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this salt water goes through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are consequently sent to drain. This process continues till all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain along with the solidity ions) and the bed is considered fully regenerated.</p>
