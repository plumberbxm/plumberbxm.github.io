<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage units. Given that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly continuous, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than need (normally night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and cleanly kept for later use when need rate exceeds supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
