I actually got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They right away cleared the initial clog, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further examination, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary issue and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>

<p>After eliminating standing water from the sink, pour about 1/2 cup of table salt down the drain before you gather the boiling water.
