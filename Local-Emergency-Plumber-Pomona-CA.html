<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common kind of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. When you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense fails (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow circumstance could happen. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company thinks about high risk" establishments.</p>
