<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common type of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. When you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense fails (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation could occur. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility considers high threat" facilities.</p>
