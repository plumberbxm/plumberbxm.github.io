<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Since I love to cook, I produce a lot of meals. We set up a temporary workaround at our visitor bathroom sink, but after a day of this we understood that we needed the sink fixed ASAP.  Fritz was in and out of the home within 30 minutes and he ensures that the sink will remain clog-free for one month. If it blocks once again within that time, he will come out and fix it for free - that is what I call service!  We are really happy that we picked Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will absolutely use this company again and again in the future.</p>
