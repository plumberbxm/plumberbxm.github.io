<p>There are generally two kinds of disposals: aluminum and stainless-steel. Aluminum disposals are the most cost-effective, costing about $70 to $150 a pop but are susceptible to corrosion and leaking. Below, we'll discuss more about which toilet problems make sense to repair and which problems require a replacement. Cal's Plumbing uses a variety of drain and sewer services throughout the Tucson, Greenvalley, Marana or Oro Valley communities.

<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are a lot of other small toilet parts that should likewise be well kept to help avoid leakages and other toilet problems. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to crack and harden or simply be so crushed that it does not fill the area as well as it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being corroded or so used that they spring a leak. We highly recommend also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in great shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
