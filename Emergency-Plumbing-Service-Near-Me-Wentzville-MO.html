If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are safety precautions you need to require to safeguard yourself, your household and your house. Some jurisdictions also enable alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water.
