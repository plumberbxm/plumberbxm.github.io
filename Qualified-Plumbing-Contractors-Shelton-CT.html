<p>Your initial step is to shut down the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, turn off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a great time to include a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is likewise a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A flexible supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware shops. Images 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. Set the height prior to you install the valve (Picture 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. Examine the directions if your valve is a different style from the one we show. After mounting the valve (Photo 6), connect the fill tube (Image 7).</p>
