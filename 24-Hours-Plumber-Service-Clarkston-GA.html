Examine the sewer lines from property to suppress connection, sewage-disposal tank, and drainage systems to completely check if pipe damage, rust, or major obstructions exist. Tree roots are one of the greatest reasons for a sewer line backup. As roots get into the drain line they can cause clogs and back up into your house.</p>
<p>Unseen sets of pipes use pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet. In a separate drain path, small pipes run from the tub and sink to eventually meet up with a larger one underneath the toilet, bring waste and wastewater from the bathroom and ultimately out of the house. A great way to decrease the amount of food waste in your kitchen is to install a garbage disposal. Rapidly and efficiently getting rid of leftover potato peels, fruit rinds and many other kinds of food waste, the disposal grinds everything into fine particles that are eliminated of the chamber and into the house drainage, waste and vent system or what you most likely call your sewer.</p>
