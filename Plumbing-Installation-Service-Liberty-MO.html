Most demand for plumbers will originate from new building and the need to repair and maintain plumbing systems in existing residences and other buildings.

<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the ideal length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, simply connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if necessary, to insert television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you may need to make a time-wasting journey to the store. To avoid this, make certain the new garbage disposal installation kit consists of a tube, or buy one individually at the same time for about $3.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of house centers carry just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" model, the door might not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
