<p>Backflow preventers must just be repaired when the information collected from the field test suggests the assembly has broken down in its performance listed below the developed minimum standard. The test procedure is a diagnostic evaluation of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to fulfill this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be fixed or if essential, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to deteriorate in its efficiency, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specifications. This suggests the assembly is repaired so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
