<p>Leakages are sly. While the time required will differ based on your house size and the variety of discovered breakdowns, it's best to reserve approximately 2 hours when you arrange an inspection. There's constantly the possibility that your plumber's previous job will run long and postpone the beginning time. If the plumber surfaces in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next consultation, they likely rushed the job (unless you have a very small plumbing system). When you call to schedule your consultation, ask how long the inspection generally takes.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it should put something back into the water. Most water softeners utilize an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when particular levels are satisfied, and the system will need to have the sodium in the salt water tank replenished.</p>
