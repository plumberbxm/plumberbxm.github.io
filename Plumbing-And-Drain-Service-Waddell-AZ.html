<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Because water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly constant, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and cleanly kept for later use when demand rate goes beyond supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
