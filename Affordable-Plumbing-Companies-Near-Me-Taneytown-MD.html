<p>Look for a jam. Something too hard to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Shut off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, switch off the breaker.) Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers.
