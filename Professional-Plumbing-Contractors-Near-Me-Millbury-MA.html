I actually got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more examination, there was a substantial obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
