<p>Water that has actually been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- corrosive.

Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is just capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (generally salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
