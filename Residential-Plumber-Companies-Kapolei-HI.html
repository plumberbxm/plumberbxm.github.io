<p>I wished to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the best first experience with the beginning of our home improvements. George and Anthony did an amazing job for us. They went above and beyond any expectations that we had. They also worked around our specific needs for our house. I will always use them and request for George particularly for all future concerns or repairs. They were prompt and gave excellent prices for what we needed done. I extremely suggest this company for all your plumbing requires.</p>

Using the wrong fitting might cause a blockage or leakage.</p>
