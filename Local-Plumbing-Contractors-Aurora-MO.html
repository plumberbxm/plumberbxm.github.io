<p>In this circumstance, unclean water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. Dual flush valves are ending up being increasingly more typical, as both customers and makers look for new ways to save water. Double flush toilets enable the user to choose the level of water required to flush the toilet based upon whether the waste is solid or liquid. We have actually all heard the old expression, "If it's yellow, let it mellow. If it's brown, flush it down." Well, lots of people discover that squicky - therefore the double flush was born so you can still flush it down if it's yellow, you're just utilizing less water to do it.</p>
