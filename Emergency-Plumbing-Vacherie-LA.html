<p>The sediment trap parts cost $10 to $14 each and plumbers will be able to install it within an hour. Basements and utility spaces feature a few of a home's essential and frequently utilized residential plumbing components. Roto-Rooter's expert plumbers supply a complete series of basement plumbing services and drain cleaning services, however basement floor drain cleaning is one of the most typical. To prep your system for installation, you might have to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cable with a plug set that I bought individually from the disposal system. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>Sometimes a clog can be triggered due to buildup and grease within the system. If this holds true, snaking the drain won't fix the problem. You might have to look into utilizing a high pressure water system to remove the clog. This procedure is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the seriousness of the clog. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the whole system.</p>
