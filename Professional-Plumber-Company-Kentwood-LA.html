A high level hazard is specified as a scenario in which the water backflow could seriously harm people. In some cities, these valves must be checked once a year by a certified professional. The device has a chamber in between 2 independent check valves where pressure is kept track of.

Connections that are too tight can in fact cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If needed, inspect for leaks and tighten them a bit more.</p>

<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many home centers carry only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" model, the door might not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
