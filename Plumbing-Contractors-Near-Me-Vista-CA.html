While particle size decrease and plant growth promo have actually been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.

The test period will not be less than 10 minutes. The piping system will endure the test pressure specified without showing any evidence of leakage or other flaws.

For instance, a 3 psi test will need an optimum 15 pound gauge. A 10 psi test might be performed using a 50 pound gauge, but not a 100 pound gauge. The piping system will be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge visible at the time of inspection.
