<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Georgetown KY</h3>
<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. Due to the fact that the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless for the most part it ought to be much less water.</p>
