<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Since water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly constant, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than need (typically night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and easily stored for later usage when demand rate goes beyond supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
