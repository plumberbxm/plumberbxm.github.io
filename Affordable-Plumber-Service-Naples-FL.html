<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, reduced iron will be removed by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are readily available if the resin has actually already been fouled. Again, it is a good idea to inspect the producer's directions for unique precautions.</p>
<p>As tough water goes through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade places with sodium ions (Figure 1). Sodium ions are held loosely and are changed quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. Throughout this procedure, complimentary" salt ions are launched into the water. Softer clothing without difficult minerals trapped in the material. Fabrics last longer and whites stay whiter without the drab gray brought on by hard water. Please send our thanks to all involved with testing, repairing, changing and servicing our softener. Value the time and service you send our way. The replacement tank has actually fixed the problem we were having.</p>
