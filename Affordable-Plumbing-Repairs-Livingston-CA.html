<p>We aren't here to sway you in one direction or the other - we install both gas and electrical water heaters - however we want to educate you on the benefits and disadvantages of both so you can make the option that best fits you. This is particularly common after returning from a getaway or not utilizing your home's water supply for an extended amount of time. It might be due to a rusty hot water heater and not the plumbing pipes in your house if this happens just when your hot water is running.</p>
<p>Your sewer line issue can result in sewer backups, and they normally occur in the lowest open drain. This type of issue is usually the outcome of a clog in the line. If you do not detect the smell coming from the sewer backup, you might determine this problem since a backup occurs whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink. Every drain in your home depends on the main sewer line for proper drainage. If, however, only one drain has backup problems, there's an isolated problem with just that drain, which is not likely to be a sewage problem.</p>
