<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in specific neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
