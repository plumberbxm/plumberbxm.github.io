<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite sensible. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
<p>To the end user (consumer), SpringWell Water (SpringWell") warrants that the following Covered products- retention tanks and mineral tanks (14" or bigger) will be without any defects in material and craftsmanship for a duration of 10-years under normal application, service and use. They were running a bit late due to earlier service calls, however I give the company props for calling to update us on the later arrival time. Some tasks take longer than expected, that's easy to understand, by keeping us notified of the minor hold-up, we didn't have to fret.</p>
