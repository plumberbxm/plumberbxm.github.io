<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Holbrook MA</h3>
<p>Reverse osmosis is the process utilized to purify water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 phases. In the prefilter phase, large particles like silt and rust are gotten rid of by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while liquified solids are captured and eliminated. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to remove any remaining impurities.</p>
<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- destructive. For this reason, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this kind of corrosion A softener is merely catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (generally salt or often potassium).</p>
