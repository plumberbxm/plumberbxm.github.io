Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.
