<h3>Discover Why Plumbing Services Are Expensive Harlem GA</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic supply of water line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was in fact promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Sadly, any home that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. Often a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and whispering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>If you spot a leak and opt for a patching job instead of a repiping job, just remember that all the pipes in your house are probably made from the same product and they might be next. To prevent further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might wish to think about repiping your entire home when you spot a leak. If your plumber's auger line is too brief to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then start at the end of the drain and work backward.</p>
