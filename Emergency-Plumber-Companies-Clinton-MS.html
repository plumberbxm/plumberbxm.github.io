Typically speaking, it's best to have a professional plumber examine your backflow preventer at least as soon as a year to guarantee it's working correctly. Much like you might not have actually discovered water contamination before you installed the preventer, you may not have the ability to see contamination if the system stops working.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers must just be fixed when the data gathered from the field test shows the assembly has deteriorated in its performance below the developed minimum standard. The test treatment is a diagnostic assessment of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to meet this minimum standard, the backflow preventer need to be repaired or if needed, changed.
