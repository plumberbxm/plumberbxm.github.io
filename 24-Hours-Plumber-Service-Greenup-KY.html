When the source of a gas leak or other issue is on a customer's gas pipe or associated connections, repair expenses can be high.</p>
<p>This ion exchange process is assisted in by resin beads in the water softener that are charged with sodium ions. This is another combination that can work on sink obstructions. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and put down the drain. Let the mix sit for a number of hours, then flush with boiling water. You can duplicate this process if it doesn't work the very first time.
