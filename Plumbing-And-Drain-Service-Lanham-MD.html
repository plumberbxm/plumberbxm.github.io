<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Most house centers carry just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. Likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
