<h3>Things To Know Before Hiring A Sewer Cleaning Company in Chandler AZ</h3>
<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a significant clog that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
