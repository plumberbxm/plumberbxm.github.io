<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on an established schedule and after that return to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt due to the fact that they restore whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, normally restore after so many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a fluctuating water utilize schedule, such designs are practical.</p>
