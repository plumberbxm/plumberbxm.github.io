A lot of plumbers will remove the old system to install the new one at the exact same per hour rate. This can increase the quantity of time required to install the new system, therefore increasing costs. This actually depends upon what condition the remainder of the pipes are in, and how difficult the old unit is to eliminate. In most cases, elimination will just include an additional $25 to $50 to the overall expenses, however in many cases the expenses might be greater if extra pipes need to also be replaced.</p>
<p>To assist prevent obstructions within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, rather than use the technique laid out above. It's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up since the baffle effectively halves the interior diameter of the tee. This is specifically true when the waste should take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
