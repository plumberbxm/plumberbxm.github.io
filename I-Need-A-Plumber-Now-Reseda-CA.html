<p>Leakages are sly. While the time needed will differ based on your home size and the number of found malfunctions, it's best to set aside up to two hours when you set up an inspection.

If the plumber surfaces in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next consultation, they likely hurried the job (unless you have a very small plumbing system). Ask how long the inspection generally takes when you call to schedule your appointment.</p>
