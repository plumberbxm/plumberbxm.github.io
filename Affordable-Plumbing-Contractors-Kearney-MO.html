<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Considering that I enjoy to prepare, I create a lot of dishes. We established a short-term workaround at our visitor bathroom sink, but after a day of this we realized that we needed the sink repaired ASAP.  Fritz was in and out of the home within 30 minutes and he ensures that the sink will stay clog-free for thirty days. If it obstructs again within that time, he will come out and fix it free of charge - that is what I call service!  We are very delighted that we chose Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will definitely use this company once again and again in the future.</p>
