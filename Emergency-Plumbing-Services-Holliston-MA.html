<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Holliston MA?</h3>
<p>Food scraps compose up to 20% of all household waste. This big amount of trash does not need to go in the trash bin if it can easily and rapidly be dealt with through the sink. A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into small pieces that are capable of traveling through the sewage pipes without restraining water flow. By setting up a garbage disposal you are assisting the environment by saving the amount of trash that gets sent to garbage dumps and other dumping areas. With a garbage disposal the garbage is handled through already existing water infrastructure.</p>
<p>Your sewer line problem can result in sewer backups, and they normally take place in the lowest open drain. This kind of issue is normally the outcome of a clog in the line. If you do not find the smell coming from the sewer backup, you might determine this problem due to the fact that a backup happens whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink. Every drain in your home depends on the main sewer line for appropriate drainage. If, however, just one drain has backup problems, there's an isolated problem with only that drain, which is not likely to be a sewage problem.</p>
