These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to weaken in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This indicates the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
