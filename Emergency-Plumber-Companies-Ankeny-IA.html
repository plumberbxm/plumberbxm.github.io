<p>An rdc is similar to a DC because it is a mechanical backflow preventer consisting of two independently acting, spring-loaded check valves. However, it typically does not consist of shutoff valves, may or might not be equipped with test cocks or ports, and is usually less reliable than a DC. An rdc is effective against backpressure backflow and backsiphonage but should be used to isolate only nonhealth hazards and is planned for use just in water service connections to single-family homes.</p>
<p>Hard water, particles from old pipes or particles from a break in a city water line can avoid a flush valve from closing entirely. Running water through it from the supply line will clear the debris. Images 1 and 2 reveal you how to do this on one typical type of valve. Although other valves will look various, the clearing process is comparable. However, you might have to get rid of a couple of screws on top of the fill valve to remove the cap.</p>
