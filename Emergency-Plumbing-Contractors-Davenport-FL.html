<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
<p>Water that has actually been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this type of deterioration A softener is simply capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (generally salt or often potassium).</p>
