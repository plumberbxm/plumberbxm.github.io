<p>A decrease in supply side pressure caused by an incident such as a water main break, or a heavy water need from activities such as fire fighting, triggers the supply pressure to drop below the consumer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Check Valve allows the excess consumer side pressure to act upon the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge until the supply side pressure once again surpasses the customer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or till the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Since water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly consistent, use never precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is greater than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and easily stored for later usage when need rate exceeds supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
