The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams backwards relative to the instructions of the system's water supply motion. This opposite flow is generally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes subject to car traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The result is a complete breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that allows water to get away. Sometimes no evident physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of a key pump whose shut down results in a significant pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
