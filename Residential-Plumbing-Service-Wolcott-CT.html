Plumber's putty can not be used on certain new sinks, however these will be identified to that impact. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. When you tighten the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel.
