<p>When you remove the cap to eliminate the valve, inspect the washer for wear or cracks. Changing a bad washer is inexpensive and simple. But discovering the right washer may not be. The most common washers are often available at home centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be hard to find. If you choose to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the store to find a match. Plumbers usually replace the entire fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
