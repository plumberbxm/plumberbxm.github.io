<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was in fact touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Unfortunately, any home that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, however when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. Often a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and whispering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
