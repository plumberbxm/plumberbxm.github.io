<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are generally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Because water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly continuous, use never precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and easily kept for later use when need rate surpasses supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
