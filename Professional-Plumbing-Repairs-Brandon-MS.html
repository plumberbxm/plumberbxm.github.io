These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Given that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately constant, usage never exactly matches supply.
