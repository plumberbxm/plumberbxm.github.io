As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending upon the length of time the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a nuisance-- for its many desired uses around your home.</p>
