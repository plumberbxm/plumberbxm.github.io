<p>Leaks are tricky. While the time required will vary based on the house size and the number of discovered malfunctions, it's best to set aside up to 2 hours when you set up an inspection. There's always the chance that your plumber's previous job will run long and postpone the beginning time. If the plumber finishes in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next consultation, they likely rushed the job (unless you have a really little plumbing system). Ask how long the inspection generally takes when you call to arrange your appointment.</p>
